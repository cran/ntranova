Description: Dealing with neutrosophic data of the form N=D+I(where N is a Neutrosophic number
   ,D is the determinant part of the number and I is  the indeterminacy part)
   using the neutrosophic two way anova test keeps the type I error low.
   This algorithm calculates the fisher statistics when we have a neutrosophic
   data, also tests two hypothesizes, first is to test differences between treatments,
   and second is to test differences between sectors. For more information see
